# Rultiple Courier Scheduling Problem

## Overview

This project addresses the **Multiple Courier Scheduling Problem** using three approaches:

- **Constraint Programming (CP)**: Implemented in MiniZinc.
- **Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)**: Implemented using the `z3` library.
- **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)**: Implemented using Gurobi with an academic license.

The goal is to minimize the maximum distance traveled by any courier while ensuring fairness in workload distribution.

## Results Summary

The models achieved good results on various configurations but encountered challenges with the most complex instances.
